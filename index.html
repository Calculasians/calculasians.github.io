			Who am I
		</h1>
		<p id="about-desc">
			Hi, or 大家好! I am currently attending UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering & 
			Computer Science. 
			My interests lie in a wide variety of topics, including embedded systems & digital design, and their
			applications in areas ranging from robotics, data science, to renewable energy. 
			<br /><br />
			Outside of the academic sphere, I may also be found playing badminton, catching up 
			on a variety of Netflix shows, or on top of a mountain. I enjoy exploring interesting places & 
			scenery in the wilderness, and I have been to many national parks across the western
			US, with many more to go. I also have a list of 20 or so languages I would like to learn
			in the future, so I may also be caught brushing up on my Turkish, or inventing a new language
			altogether.
			<br /><br />
			Well, enough reading, check out some of my projects below!

				One of my longtime passions is learning foreign languages and discovering exotic cultures

				I have been learning Japanese since 2014 through reading, listening, and
				watching a large quantity of Japanese articles & media. 
				Recently, I have also taken Advanced Japanese at Berkeley. <br />I have also self-studied 
				Spanish, Turkish, and (my favorite language) Polish over the past few years, and given the endless quantity
				of languages on the planet, I plan to immerse myself in many more languages & cultures
				into the future, and put these languages to use in diverse fields and applications.
