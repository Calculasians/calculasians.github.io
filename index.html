			Who am I
		</h1>
		<p id="about-desc">
			Hi, or 大家好! I am currently attending UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering & 
			Computer Science. 
			<br /><br />
			Within the academic sphere, my Berkeley education has been characterized by a distinct ability to 
			be hooked by any random class I hear about. The consequence is that I have taken a wide range of classes in
			EECS, such as Security, Algorithms, and Digital Logic Design, as well as cool topics outside of EECS as well, 
			such as Japanese. Right now,
			my work experience centers around FPGA/ASIC design, but who knows where the wind blows me in the future?
			<br /><br />
			Outside of the academic sphere, I may also be found playing frisbee or badminton (rarely), binging Youtube videos, 
			or on top of a mountain. I also have a list of 20 or so languages I would like to learn
			in the future, so I may also be caught brushing up on my Turkish, or inventing a new language
			altogether.

			<div id="proj-desc">
				One of my longtime passions is learning foreign languages and discovering exotic cultures
				around the world. <br />
				I have been learning Japanese since 2014 through reading, listening, and
				watching a large quantity of Japanese articles & media. 
				Recently, I have also taken Advanced Japanese at Berkeley. <br />I have also self-studied 
				Spanish, Turkish, and (my favorite language) Polish over the past few years, and given the endless quantity
				of languages on the planet, this endeavour will see no end.
