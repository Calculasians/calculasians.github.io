			Who am I
		</h1>
		<p id="about-desc">
			Hi, or 大家好! I am currently attending UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering & 
			Computer Science. 
			My interests lie in a wide variety of topics, including embedded systems & AI, and their
			applications in areas ranging from robotics to renewable energy. 
			<br /><br />
			Outside of the academic sphere, I may also be found playing badminton, catching up 
			on a variety of Netflix shows, or on top of a mountain. I enjoy exploring interesting places & 
			scenery in the wilderness, and I have been to 30 national parks across the western
			US, with many more to go.
			<br /><br />
			Lastly, one of my greatest personal hobbies is foreign language learning. As a child, I was 
			fascinated by the "polyglots" I would see on Youtube. I have dabbled in
			quite a few languages in the past, as well as having self-studied to a considerable level, 
			Japanese, Spanish, and my favorite language, Polish. I am interested in how languages evolved
			over time, as well as exciting hobbies such as creating exotic conlangs.
			<br /><br />
			Well, enough reading, check out some of my projects below!
